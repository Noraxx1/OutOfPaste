# What is Out Of Paste?
Out Of Paste is a self-hosted alternative to traditional pastebin services. Unlike NoPaste, which encodes pastes in the URL using base64, Out Of Paste saves content directly on the server. It features a modern web interface, an easy-to-configure setup, and advanced settings for those seeking greater customization.

## Features
- Rate limit to prevent users from creating too many files.
- Modern UI (the UI is mostly based on the NoPaste UI!)
> [!NOTE]  
> Features such as:
> - Rate limit configuration.
> - Database support(right now you can only save pastes in to text files).
> - Encryption support.
> - Raw mode.
> - Fork and edit pastes.
> - Markdown.
>   Are coming soon!

# Hosting
> [!WARNING]
